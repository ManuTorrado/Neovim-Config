# Neovim-Config

To manage Neovim plugins there are several options.
Im currently using nvim packer.

Once I start my nvim session I can install my listed packages on ~/.config/nvim/lua/plugins.lua with Vim commands :PackerInstall or :PackerSync

vim-plug  also helps to manage some plugins with PlugInstall
